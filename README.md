# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this project is to display the current day as well as the 5-day weather forecast for the searched city. The cities searched are saved to local storage to be displayed on page reload so that the user does not have to research for the city.

## Credits

I utilized the study material provided by the institution as a reference to complete my application.

Following are the documents I used to help me write code:
- https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
- https://api.jquery.com/
- https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
- https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
- https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api

## Tests

Users can test the application by searching for as many cities as possible

## How to Contribute

My application's goal was to establish a connection with geocoding API and open weather API which I accomplished. The local storage can stores duplicate values. You can contribute by fixing this issue.
